          These Terms of Service (the &quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of websites, portals, and online services operated by ROI Home Services (&quot;ROI Home Services,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing or using our Sites or Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Sites or Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Not legal, tax, or lending advice.</strong> We are not a law firm or a mortgage lender/broker. Legal and lending services are provided by or under the supervision of licensed third parties you engage. Appraisal services, when provided, are independent and USPAP‑compliant.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. To access certain features, you may be required to create an account and provide accurate information. You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and for all activity under your account.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Changes to Terms or Services</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify these Terms or our Services at any time. Material changes will be posted with a new &quot;Last updated&quot; date. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Sites or Services without notice.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Violate any law, regulation, or third‑party rights.</li>
          <li>Upload or transmit malware or engage in security violations.</li>
          <li>Scrape, index, or reverse engineer the Sites (except as permitted by law).</li>
          <li>Misrepresent identity, property information, or authorization to share data.</li>
          <li>Interfere with the operation of the Sites or the use by others. We may monitor use and enforce these Terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Content & License</h2>
        <p>
          If you upload, submit, or share content (&quot;User Content&quot;), you grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to host, store, reproduce, and display it solely to operate and improve the Services and to fulfill your engagement. You represent that you have all rights necessary to grant this license and that your User Content does not infringe the rights of others. We may remove content that violates law or these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third‑Party Services & Links</h2>
        <p>
          The Sites may link to or integrate third‑party services (e.g., maps, scheduling, payments, MLS, analytics). We are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of those services is governed by their terms.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Sites, Services, reports, designs, text, graphics, software, and other materials we provide (collectively, the &quot;ROI Content&quot;) are owned by ROI Home Services or its licensors and are protected by intellectual‑property laws. Except as expressly allowed, you may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works of the ROI Content. All trademarks, service marks, and logos are the property of their respective owners.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Professional Disclosures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Appraisal independence.</strong> When we provide appraisal services, they are performed independently and in compliance with USPAP. Conclusions are professional opinions, not guarantees of value, price, or timing.</li>
            <li><strong>No legal/tax/lending advice.</strong> Any legal or lending work is performed by or under the supervision of licensed professionals you engage. Our deliverables support—not replace—your professional advisors’ judgment.</li>
            <li><strong>Market variability.</strong> Real‑estate markets, regulations, taxes, and insurance conditions change. Analyses reflect information available as of the report date and are subject to change.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Appointments, Access & Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          If site access or appointments are required, you must ensure safe and lawful access. You may cancel or reschedule with reasonable notice; fees may apply for late cancellations, missed appointments, or additional site visits if caused by access issues.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Payments & Invoicing</h2>
        <p>
          Fees, payment schedules, and expenses (if any) are set out in your proposal, order form, or engagement letter. Unless otherwise stated, invoices are due upon receipt. Late amounts may accrue interest or collection costs as allowed by law. We may suspend Services for non‑payment.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
          We will take reasonable steps to keep non‑public information you provide confidential and use it only to perform the Services, except where disclosure is required by law, by your written direction, or to protect rights or safety. See our Privacy Policy for details on personal‑information handling.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Electronic Communications & Signatures</h2>
        <p>
          By providing an email address or phone number, you consent to receive communications (including texts) related to the Services. You can opt out of marketing messages at any time. Electronic signatures and records are valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          THE SITES AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, OR NON‑INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITES OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR‑FREE, OR SECURE.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ROI HOME SERVICES AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITES OR SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those cases, the limitations apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ROI Home Services and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Sites or Services; (b) your User Content; (c) your violation of these Terms or applicable law; or (d) your violation of any third‑party rights.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may terminate or suspend access to the Sites or Services at any time, with or without cause or notice. You may stop using the Sites or Services at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive (including Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and Governing Law).
        </p>

        <h2>16. Governing Law; Venue</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state and federal courts located in Orange County, Florida for any dispute not subject to arbitration (if applicable) or where injunctive relief is sought.
        </p>

        <h2>17. Dispute Resolution (Optional Arbitration)</h2>
        <p>
          If a dispute arises, the parties will first attempt to resolve it informally in good faith within 30 days. If unresolved, either party may elect binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration will be Orange County, Florida. Each party bears its own fees and costs. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. This section does not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief in court.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer not to use arbitration, notify us at admin@myroihome.com within 30 days of first use; the dispute will instead proceed exclusively in the courts specified in Section 16.
        </p>

        <h2>18. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>
          We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform due to events beyond our reasonable control, including acts of God, labor disputes, power or internet failures, vendor outages, epidemics, war, or governmental actions.
        </p>

        <h2>19. Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in connection with a merger, sale, or reorganization.
        </p>

        <h2>20. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Sites and Services and supersede prior agreements on that subject. If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right is not a waiver. Headings are for convenience only.
